        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Time consuming but it is well worth it! The brown sugar and bacon grease combine beautifully and give such a great taste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sliced bacon, cut into thirds</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package beef cocktail wieners</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Refrigerate 2/3 of the bacon until needed. It is easier to wrap the wieners with cold bacon. Wrap each cocktail wiener with a piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Place on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle brown sugar generously over all.</li>
            <li>Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sugar is bubbly. To serve, place the wieners in a slow cooker and keep on the low setting.</li>
        </ol>
